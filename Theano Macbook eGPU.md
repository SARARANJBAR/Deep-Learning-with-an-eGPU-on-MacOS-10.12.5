# Get Theano (TensorFlow / Keras) running on a Macbook Pro with an eGPU
July 22 2017

### Hardware Requirements (what I used):
1. a Macbook Pro 15-inch (MacBookPro13,3 Intel Core i7 @ 2.9 GHz 16 GB ram) running Mac OS 10.12.5 Sierra. Though this process should work on any Mac with Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C
1. a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU enclosure. Make sure it has the TI83 Thunderbolt 3 chipset. For more info see this site: [eGPU Buyers Guide](https://egpu.io/external-gpu-buyers-guide-2017/). Lots of good info there. I chose the [Mantiz Venus](https://mymantiz.com/collections/shop/products/mz-02-venus?variant=28876425155). It arrived 4 days after I ordered it (shipped from Singapore). See Figure 1. The Mantiz website says the Venus requires a host running Windows 10. Don't worry - it works just fine with Mac OS 10.12.5 Sierra, after you apply a kernel patch (more below). The kernel patch requirment should [go away once Mac OS High Sierra is released](https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/07/hands-on-macos-high-sierra-native-egpu-support-shows-promise-video/). The Venus has a number of other nice features (read the review on the Buyers Guide), one of which is the ability to charge the Macbook Pro over the TB3 connection.
1. a recent NVIDIA GPU. I chose the [eVGA GTX 1080Ti](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y11DFZ3/). This is based on the NVIDIA Pascal architecture. This card fits nicely inside the Mantiz Venus, with good air circulation around the GPU. The card draws 250 watts, well within the limits available for PCI cards installed in the Venus. So far, everything has been stable (2 days).

### Hardware Installation Tips
* The Mantiz Venus user's guide asks you make sure the unit is unplugged, then to unscrew the "card holder". This is a small L-shaped metal bracket. However, this causes the card holder to fall down inside the Venus, and strike the motherboard! My suggestion is to first remove the perforated side panel from the Venus. You can just pull it off. There are soft plugs that hold it in place. Next, place your hand inside the unit, above the Venus motherboard, near the rear of the unit and _below_ the card holder so you can catch it. _Now_  unscrew the card holder!
* I recommend attaching the internal power cables to the GPU before you install it in the Venus PCI-e slot. It is tough to connect the power cables after the GPU is installed in the slot.
* Once you have the GPU installed and connected to power cables, you can connect the external power cord and plug it into the wall. If you turn the Venus on via its rear power switch, nothing will happen! This was a bit of a shock. Do not worry. Eventually I figured out that the Venus will not power on until after it is connected to a host via the TB3 / USB-C cable! Would be nice for Mantiz to mention this in the (very brief) user guide.

### Software Requirements 
1. [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io) Download and install. Next, add conda-forge to the list of channels anaconda searches for packages. At the command line enter: "_conda config --append channels conda-forge_". This adds conda-forge to the search list for _all_ Anaconda environments. Now, create a new environment for Python 2.7 with the following command: "_conda create --name deeplearning python=2.7_". Activate the new environment by entering: _"source activate deeplearning"_
1. [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) (version 0.9.0 as of this writing). You can get this via conda. At the command line enter: _"conda install theano"_.
1. _Optional and not tested:_ [Keras](https://keras.io) (which will also install TensorFlow). Enter this command: _"conda install keras"_
1. Xcode 8.2.1. Note: this is not the current release of Xcode. You _must_ use version 8.2.1. Newer versions of Xcode are incompatible with the deep learning environment we are creating. Xcode 8.2.1 may be obtained from [Apple's Developer Website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/). Access to Apple's Dev website requires a (free) account. Just do it. We need (this version of) Xcode for its compiler. Theano needs _clang_ to compile functions (train / test / validate, for example) on the fly. If you already have a newer version of Xcode installed, no problem! Install v8.2.1 in its own directory, say _/Applications/Xcode8.2.1_. You can make v8.2.1 the "active" version by entering the following command: _"sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode8.2.1/Contents/Developer"_.
1. A Mac OS kernel extension (kext) that recognizes the eGPU. Fortunately, installing this has been totally automated for you by [goalque](https://github.com/goalque/automate-eGPU). I recommend following the very nice instructions over at [9to5Mac.com](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/11/hands-on-powering-the-macbook-pro-with-an-egpu-using-nvidias-new-pascal-drivers/). After you are done, you will have to reboot your Mac (at least once). Then the eGPU should show up in your _System Report_. Note: after installing this kext, my Macbook Pro displays a very glitchy screen during its boot. The boot progress bar continues to advance on the glitchy screen, and eventually the Finder comes up looking just fine. As I mentioned above, this step should go away with Mac OS High Sierra.
